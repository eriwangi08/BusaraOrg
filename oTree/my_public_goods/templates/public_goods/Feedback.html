        Suppose in a group, 1 participant contributed 10 points, 1 participant contributed 5,
        and 1 participant contributed nothing. What would be the payoff of the participant who contributed 10 points?
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Solution: 9 points</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Total contribution from all participants was 10+5+0=15. Total earnings from the project were 15*1.8=27.
        Each participant got an equal share of the earnings, that is, 27/3=9. Hence, payoff for the participant who contributed 10 points
        was 10-10+9=9.
